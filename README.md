"# Diamond" 

Operation:
	The program first prints a blank line.
	It prompts the user "Enter either 191 or 919, anything else will quit:         ".
	It reads the input value from the same line of the above message.
	It prints a blank line after reading the input.
	Depending on the input value, the program displays one of the three outputs as shown in the above screenshot.
	If the input is neither 191 nor 919, or a value not beginning with 191 or 919, the program quits after a final message "Good bye!". Otherwise, it repeats step 1 to 5. That is, the program keeps running for an input of 191 or 919. It stops only if the input is neither 191 nor 919, or a value not beginning with 191 or 919.
